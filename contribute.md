The PierceHacker project is dedicated to fostering a sustainable venue for the open publishing of tutorials and other resources that support the development of a robust, critical information competency within the Pierce College community. 

PierceHacker exists as an ongoing open pedagogy project within Jason Loan's Technical Writing (English 235) courses at Pierce; however, we do welcome and hope to facilitate contributions from the community at large.

Here are a handful of ways you can contribute to this project:

## Compose a Tutorial

Have an idea for a novice-friendly technology tutorial? PierceHacker wants to work with you to publish it here! We are looking for tutorials and lessons that illuminate and develop the learning of technological skills that help faciliate a diverse community of learners being able to thrive in an evolving world. 

Teachers -- use a technology in your course (or life) that you think might benefit students across the curriculum or beyond? Get in touch with us.

Students -- use a technology in or outside your course work that you think might benefit your peers in their own life and work? Get in touch with us.

Check out our tutorial proposal form.

## Write for Our Blog

In addition to tutorials, PierceHacker also seeks to publish blog posts that creatively, critically, and/or reflectively explore issues related to technology both in and outside of the classroom. 

For example, do you have knowledge of or experience with an issue like [digital redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_redlining)? Share your knowledge. Let us work with you to publish a blog post about it. 

Check out our blog post proposal form.

## Use PierceHacker in Your Class

The PierceHacker site -- even while in the incubation stages -- is always live and public. 

#### Links to Resources
We encourage you to share links to existing tutorials relevant to your courses.

#### Class Projects

We also encourage you to develop writing assignments or projects using PierceHacker in your class: 

* Use a particular technology in your courses that students struggle with? Have them learn it by trying to teach it to another. Ask them to propose and compose a tutorial for us. Each one; teach one.
* Want students to write creatively, critically, or reflectively about technology? Ask them to propose and compose a blog for us.
* Want students to practice reviewing and providing tutorials and blog posts in progress? Ask them to review and provide feedback on new content for us.
* Need a [rhetorical situation](https://wac.colostate.edu/resources/wac/intro/rhetoric/) for a writing assignment? Let us be your rhetorical situation.

At the moment we do not yet have any specific lesson plans or modules for use in your classes. Those are forthcoming. But we encourage you to contact us to discuss possibilites and logistics. We cannot, of course, publish everything proposed and composed for us, but we would sure like to try. 

## Join the PierceHacker Team

PierceHacker runs via volunteer and class project power. At the moment the sole volunteer for the project is Jason Loan. When Jason teaches Technical Writing, which is often, he also invites students to engage and contribute to the work of PierceHacker.
