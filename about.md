# Origins

PierceHacker began (and continues) as a project in a Technical Writing Course [Jason](http://musicforparkinglots.com/) first taught taught at Pierce College in Fall 2018. Modeled after [ProfHacker](https://profhacker.com/) and [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) and further inspired by work in ["Open Pedagogy"](http://openpedagogy.org/open-pedagogy/) and the desire to move away from the ["disposable assignment."](https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2975)

In addition to the resource work described above, PierceHacker aims to provide a venue for students and teachers at Pierce College (and beyond) to become producers and simply consumers of content within the [knowledge commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons).
