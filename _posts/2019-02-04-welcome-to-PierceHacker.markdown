PierceHacker officially gets off the ground this quarter. At its core, PierceHacker is an [open pedagogy project](https://www.jessestommel.com/textbooks-oer-and-the-need-for-open-pedagogy/) designed to facilitate students and other members of the Pierce College community being able to become producers of knowledge rather than simply consumers.

Specifically, PierceHacker seeks to develop a robust, critical practice of information competency, [a core ability](https://www.pierce.ctc.edu/degree-outcomes) of the general education outcomes of Pierce College.

As of Winter 2019, PierceHacker operates primarily as a project of Jason Loan's Technical Writing Course. We do, however, wish to invite the immediate contributions and feedback of the Pierce Community at large. 

Please explore the site to learn more and do not hesiatte to get in touch.

Hope to hear from you soon.
